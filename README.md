# Intelligent-thesis-Topic-Recommender
Researching a suitable thesis topic and choosing a methodology could be challenging for many students, especially those enrolled in conversion courses toward master's degrees or who require guidance in selecting a topic. Therefore, there is a need for a chatbot-based recommender system that generates high-quality research ideas based on user preferences, streamlining the information retrieval process by providing specific and customized subject suggestions and connections to related journals and supervisors. The main goal of this research was to create a personalized chatbot that, compared to the current ChatGPT model, could more accurately and efficiently suggest thesis ideas and supervisors depending on user input. This paper thus proposed an interactive, intelligent project topic recommendation leveraging open AI. This study also tends to overcome chatGPT limitation of hallucination, concise memory and suggestion of non-existent journals by using prompt engineering and cognitive architecture to give a more specific and accurate result, Google API for journal links and elastic search for supervisor suggestions. This research used The GPT-3.5-Turbo model to produce a response to a collection of input messages using the OpenAI, performed GPT3 completion using Prompt, Text Davinci 003 as the default engine, temperature parameter to regulate the output's level of unpredictability, limiting the probability mass to the top-p most likely tokens, Token, Frequency Penalty (freq pen), Pres pen and Stop. Also, using prompt engineering and cognitive architecture, a scenario based on user input was created using Prompt Addition, Answer Search, Answer Mapping, Cognitive AI and Flattening. Furthermore, strings of Text with attached Google API were created, and an elastic search for supervisors using fuzzy search was performed.
According to the findings, the outcomes demonstrated that the customized Chatbot, called Researchy, could propose thesis topics, journal links and supervisors more precisely and effectively than the ChatGPT model. Additionally, the Chatbot's natural language processing capabilities and recommendation accuracy were improved using cognitive AI approaches. Additionally, connections to relevant journals and supervisor suggestions were provided more effectively using the Google Custom API and Elastic Search, which demonstrated that Researchy could recommend better Journal and supervisor recommendations that were more personalized, efficient, and accurate than ChatGPT, thus overcoming the limitations of the existing model. Also, to assess the performance of the personalized Chatbot, a survey was conducted, and the results showed that the majority of respondents reported being very satisfied with the Chatbot's performance in providing relevant thesis topics for their research area, timely responses to their queries, understanding their questions and responding appropriately, and suggesting helpful journal links for their research. Additionally, the majority of respondents reported being very satisfied with the overall performance of the Chatbot and expressed a willingness to recommend and use Researchy again in the future.
This study highlighted the potential of cognitive AI approaches to significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of academic support services for students, especially in remote learning and virtual support. With further development and refinement, Researchy and similar chatbots could enhance the quality of academic advising and support services, ultimately leading to more successful outcomes for students in their academic pursuits. It is therefore recommended that alternative methods for sharing the model with testers, such as using cloud-based solutions or creating a web-based platform can be explored, more work could be focused on generating synthetic data and training a model for the Researchy rather than relying on existing openA1 APIs, a web-based version of Researchy could be developed to be accessed from anywhere with an internet connection, integrating the bot into the university's website could make it more accessible to students and provide an opportunity to track student progress and strengths in different modules and the scope of Researchy's recommendations could be expanded beyond the School of Engineering to include other departments within the university or even other universities making the bot more valuable to a larger population of students and future research could explore the possibility of further incorporating more advanced technologies, such as sentiment analysis, to improve the bot's recommendation accuracy and overall performance..
